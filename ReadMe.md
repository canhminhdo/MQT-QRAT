# QRAT: A Reachability Analysis Tool for Quantum Programs
This repository presents a reachablity analysis tool for quantum programs called `QRAT`. The tool is written in C++ using [MQT Core](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core) to simulate quantum computation.

## Dependencies
- [MQT Core](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core) - The Backbone of the Munich Quantum Toolkit
- [C++ Compilier](https://clang.llvm.org) - Supporting C++17
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) - A minimum version of 3.19
- [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) - A testing framework for C++ (only used in tests)
